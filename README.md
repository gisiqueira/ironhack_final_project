## Purpose
The Academy Awards ceremony, also knowns as Oscar, is arguably the most important awards show in the entertainment industry. On Sunday, March 25, we will meet the winners of the 94th ceremony, and I place my bet, that is, my prediction using machine learning for the winner of the 2021 Best Picture.
